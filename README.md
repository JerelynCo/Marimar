* Map the health facilities so that researchers and the gov’t agencies can measure geographic accessibility of health centers to the community.
* View health outcomes and health financing data and how it's distributed geographically.
* Inform the public on what/how DoH programs are faring. (Are these effective? Are the finances utilized well?)
